this is NewsApp  here  I develop using recyclerView, fragment,table layout,web view.
news having different category like general,health,entertainment ,Sports ,technology ,science
using table layout and fragment i developed different category.
when you click particular news it display whole news for that to display detailed news i used webview. 
Mostly i used realtive layout only.
